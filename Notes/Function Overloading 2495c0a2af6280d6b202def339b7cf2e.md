# Function Overloading

Two or more functions having same name.

Function Overloading is the giving same name to different function having same behaviour. So that programmer donâ€™t have to remember names for different functions.

**How compiler knows which function to call:**

It examines the argument of function call. If integer then integer is called if double then double is called.

**Rules:**

Function name must be same.

Arguments number and type should be different.

the order of parameters also matters if type differ.

Oveloading cannot happen only based on return type.
